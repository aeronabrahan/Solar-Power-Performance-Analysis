## Problem Statement
Electricity costs continue to rise, and **solar power adoption alone does not guarantee maximum savings**. Homeowners need **actionable insights** on:
- **When to use appliances** for **maximum solar efficiency**  
- **How to reduce grid dependency** for better energy independence  
- **When to clean panels** to **prevent efficiency drops**  
- **How much money is saved** and the **ROI of their solar investment**  

A **data-driven solution** is required to help homeowners make **smarter energy decisions** and **maximize their solar investment**.

## Objective

### Strategic Goals
- **Optimize energy efficiency** by identifying peak solar hours for optimal appliance usage  
- **Improve solar utilization monitoring** to detect potential panel maintenance needs  
- **Minimize electricity costs** through data-driven decisions  
- **Analyze return on investment (ROI)** to quantify financial savings and long-term benefits  

### Pain Point
Traditional energy monitoring does not provide insights into **how to optimize solar power usage**. Without **real-time tracking**, energy efficiency is **not maximized**, and cost savings are **not fully realized**.

### Ideal Solution
A **Power BI dashboard** that provides:
- **Real-time solar energy production insights**
- **Best time to run appliances** for free solar energy  
- **Grid dependency tracking** to optimize energy consumption  
- **Cost savings analysis** from solar energy usage  
- **Actionable insights** to reduce electricity expenses

## User Story
*"As a homeowner who has invested in solar energy, I want to monitor solar production, consumption, and grid usage in real time so that I can make **data-driven decisions** on when to use high-power appliances and how to **maximize solar efficiency while minimizing costs**."*

*"Since installing solar panels last year, Iâ€™ve seen the benefits of reduced electricity expenses, but I know thereâ€™s **room for improvement**. I want to identify the **best times to use appliances**, track how much Iâ€™m **saving**, and determine whether my **solar panels need cleaning or maintenance** to ensure optimal efficiency. By leveraging **insights from data**, I aim to **reduce grid dependency** and **maximize my return on investment** over time."*
